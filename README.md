# Haskell Enigma Simulator

Simulates the rotor-system of an _Enigma-I_ machine in Haskell.

I developed this after watching the great movie _"The Imitation Game"_ to gain a deeper knowledge of how the _Enigma-I_ machine worked.
This project is **NOT** meant to glorify Nazi-technology.

> The Enigma machine is an encryption device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication.
> It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military.
